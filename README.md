# XMRig_Arch32
XMRig built specifically for 32bit Linux - built for Arch32

This is built with no modifications whatsoever from https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig
The releases the XMRig DEVs upload only has 64 bit versions, so here we are - 32 bit versions!

I make no guarantee that this will work for your 32 bit Linux system.
This was built on Arch32 2020.07.03-i686 release, running in a virtual box VM with 4 virtual processors and 2 Gigs of ram.

I have disabled the donation fee for my convenience, but any users who download this are encouraged to make a donation to the DEVs;
their wallet address can be found on their github page, which is linked above
